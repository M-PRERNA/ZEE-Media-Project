        "The sale was handled by CBRE Group.\n",

        "Still the building is among the best known in the city, even to people who have never been to New York.\n",
        "It is famous for its triangle-shaped, vaulted windows worked into the stylized crown, along with its distinctive eagle gargoyles near the top.\n",
        "It has been featured prominently in many films, including Men in Black 3, Spider-Man, Armageddon, Two Weeks Notice and Independence Day.\n",
        "The previous sale took place just before the 2008 financial meltdown led to a plunge in real estate prices.\n",

        "Blackstone Group (BX) bought it for $1.3 billion 2015.\n",
        "The Chrysler Building was the headquarters of the American automaker until 1953, but it was named for and owned by Chrysler chief Walter Chrysler, not the company itself.\n",
        "Walter Chrysler had set out to build the tallest building in the world, a competition at that time with another Manhattan skyscraper under construction at 40 Wall Street at the south end of Manhattan. He kept secret the plans for the spire that would grace the top of the building, building it inside the structure and out of view of the public until 40 Wall Street was complete.\n",
